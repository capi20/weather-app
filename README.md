# weather-app

This is a weather forecast application build with NodeJS. In this project, I've used mapbox API to get co-ordinates of a given location and darkSky API to fetch weather information for that particular co-ordinates. You have to paste your mapbox and darkSky API keys in geocode.js and forecast.js respectively which you can find under utils folder. You can use below link to get your mapbox and darkSKy API keys
